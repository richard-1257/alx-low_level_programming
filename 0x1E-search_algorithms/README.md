# C - Search Algorithms

This was my ALX project on search algorithms. I implemented various types of search algorithms and stated the corresponding space/time complexities for each.

## Tests ðŸ§ª
[Tests](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by ALX.

## Helper Files ðŸ™Œ
[listint](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/listint): Folder of helper files for task 12, singly linked list jump search.
  - [create_list.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/listint/create_list.c): C function that creates a `listint_t` singly linked list.
  - [free_list.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/listint/free_list.c): C function that frees a `listint_t` singly linked list.
  - [print_list.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/listint/print_list.c): C function that prints the contents of a `listint_t` singly linked list.
  
[skiplist](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/skiplist): Folder of helper files for task 13, singly skipped list jump search.
